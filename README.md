git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi_audio_importer.git
cd multi_audio_importer
# Then install multi_audio_importer.py through Blender as above
```

## 📋 Requirements

- **Blender 3.0 or higher**
- **Internet connection** (for initial FFmpeg binary download)
- **Linux operating system** (other platforms untested)
- **~80MB free disk space** (for FFmpeg static binaries)

## 🎯 Usage

### First Time Setup
1. After installing the addon, open the **Video Sequence Editor** workspace in Blender
2. In the sidebar (press `N` if not visible), look for the **"Multi-Audio"** tab
3. The addon will automatically download FFmpeg binaries on first use (~40MB download)

### Importing Videos
1. **Open Video Sequence Editor**: Switch to the Video Editing workspace
2. **Locate the Addon Panel**: Find "Multi-Audio Import" in the sidebar (N-panel)
3. **Select Video File**: Click the folder icon next to "Video File" and choose your video
4. **Import**: Click "Import Video & All Audio (Meta)" 
5. **Done!** Your video and all audio tracks are now in a metastrip on your timeline

### Working with Metastrips
- **Enter Metastrip**: Double-click the metastrip to edit individual tracks
- **Exit Metastrip**: Press `Tab` or click the back arrow
- **Organize Tracks**: Inside the metastrip, each audio track is on its own channel
- **Track Names**: Audio tracks are labeled with language/track information when available

## 🎨 Example Workflow

```
1. Video file: "movie.mkv" (contains video + English + Spanish + Commentary audio)
   ↓
2. Import with addon
   ↓  
3. Result: Single metastrip "Meta_movie" containing:
   - Channel 1: Video track
   - Channel 2: Audio_eng_movie  
   - Channel 3: Audio_spa_movie
   - Channel 4: Audio_Track_3_movie (commentary)
```

## ⚙️ Addon Preferences

Access via `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Multi-Audio Track Video Importer`:

- **✅ Binary Status**: Shows if FFmpeg binaries are installed
- **🔄 Re-download**: Manually re-download FFmpeg binaries if needed
- **📍 Location**: Shows where binaries are stored

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "FFmpeg binaries not found"
- **Solution**: Go to addon preferences and click "Download FFmpeg Static Binaries"
- **Cause**: Usually happens if initial auto-download failed

### "Failed to scan audio tracks"
- **Check**: Ensure your video file actually contains audio tracks
- **Try**: Re-download FFmpeg binaries in addon preferences
- **Verify**: File path is correct and file isn't corrupted

### Import button disabled/greyed out
- **Solution**: This issue has been resolved in v2.0 - the button should always be enabled
- **If persists**: Restart Blender and re-enable the addon

### Video imports but no audio
- **Check**: Your video file may not have multiple audio tracks
- **Verify**: Try the file in a media player that shows track information (like VLC)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How It Works
1. Uses `ffprobe` to scan video files for audio track information
2. Extracts each audio track to temporary WAV files using `ffmpeg`  
3. Imports video and audio files as separate strips in Blender's VSE
4. Groups all strips into a single metastrip for organization
5. Names tracks based on language tags or track indices

### FFmpeg Integration
- Downloads static FFmpeg binaries automatically (no system installation required)
- Binaries are stored in the addon directory
- Uses industry-standard FFmpeg for maximum compatibility
- Supports virtually all video formats that contain multiple audio tracks
